# Sequence-Detector-using-Mealy-Finite-State-Machine
This project implements a Mealy Finite State Machine (FSM) to detect a specific binary input sequence from a serial data stream. In a Mealy machine, the output depends on both the current state and the input, allowing faster detection compared to a Moore FSM.
